# The P.R.I.S.M (Player Responsive Interactive Sensory Matrix)
---
## 1. Executive Summary (Overview)

<p>  The application of The PRISM is software that connects speakers and lighting with in-game aspects. This would include changing sound and lighting specs based on the current game and situation the player is in.. For example, in a cave scene in Minecraft, there would be more echo for the speakers and darker lighting, which is all controlled via bluetooth with the software. To be specific, it wouldn’t be all that different than a regular bluetooth speaker or lighting system, just run through another layer of code to make the changes detailed in Part 3.
</p>

<p>  The target audience of our product is teens and young adults who enjoy playing video games. Since our product is focused towards gaming, the main demographic of video gaming is teens to young adults.
</p>

<p>  The key problem that our product solves is the full immersion into the world of a video game is blocked partially by outside aspects or distractions. Our product serves as the protection from these many distractions and keeps you within the world that you chose to be in.
</p>

<p>  The key features that our product provides are speakers that are connected to the system, which controls all sound coming from the game itself. The speakers would be set up similar to surround-sound, but reactive to the video game world. The lighting works in a similar way, as the lights are connected to the system, and emit the correct amount of lighting and coloring if needed. All of this connected, the immersion into the game will be better than everything before it.
